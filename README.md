# GameofThree

Solution and Design:

-> I implemented client - server communication via Socket API for a 2 player game.
-> The server and client runs independently and communicates with each other and data is sent across both streams at the same time.
-> In this game, one player acts as a server and creates a server socket, bound it to a port number and wait for a client.
After the server is waiting, a client player instantiates a Socket object, specifying the server name and the port number to connect to.
-> After the connection is established, communication between 2 players occurs over I/O streams.
-> As soon as the server starts, the client initiates the game and prompts if the input has to be given manually or automatically.
-> If manual is chosen, then it allows user to provide the input.
-> If automatic is chosen, then a random number is generated by the client and sent to the server and the game begins.
-> The game continues until one of the player has reached 1, after which the the game ends.
